# Breadcrumb Builder

Navigation can greatly enhance the way users find their way around. In terms of usability, breadcrumbs reduce the number of actions a website visitor needs to take in order to get to a higher-level page, and they improve the findability of website sections and pages. They are also an effective visual aid that indicates the location of the user within the websiteâ€™s hierarchy, making it a great source of contextual information for landing pages.

## Installation

```sh
composer require hoppinger/path_breadcrumb_builder
```
